# Technology for Good — Campaign Details

## Campaign overview

"Technology for Good" is a Rural Internet Access and Digital Literacy Program focused on bringing reliable connectivity and practical digital skills to students and communities in underserved rural areas. Many rural regions face limited broadband infrastructure, high connection costs, and a shortage of trained educators for digital literacy. This campaign funds community-based access points, classroom connectivity, and structured digital literacy courses so learners can participate in the digital economy, access remote learning, and connect with mentors.

## Timeline & Milestones (90-day campaign)

- Week 0–4: Setup & pilot
  - Secure vendor partnerships for hardware and ISP agreements
  - Pilot installation at 2 community schools / hubs
  - Launch campaign microsite and curriculum drafting

- Week 5–8: Coverage expansion & curriculum finalization
  - Install additional access points (10–15 sites) and activate data plans
  - Finalize and localize course modules
  - Launch speed-test and coverage mapping dashboards

- Week 9–12: Course launches & mentor program rollout
  - Enroll first cohort of students in Digital Basics and Online Safety
  - Roll out mentor matching and weekly study groups
  - Begin course completion tracking and issue certificates

## Impact statement

This campaign bridges connectivity gaps and builds practical digital skills. Expected outcomes in the first 12 months:

- 10–15 community access points brought online, serving hundreds of students
- 500+ learners introduced to foundational digital skills
- Increased access to remote learning resources and job search tools
- Mentor-driven support for student projects and employment preparation

By investing in both infrastructure and human capacity, we move beyond one-off device donations toward sustainable digital inclusion.

## Team & Organization

Our implementation partners are a coalition of local NGOs and community schools experienced in education and rural infrastructure. The project team includes:

- Program Lead — coordinates partners and timelines
- Technical Lead — network design, hardware procurement, and installation
- Curriculum Lead — instructional design and localization
- Mentors & Trainers — local educators and volunteer mentors

If you want to partner, volunteer as a mentor, or help localize curriculum materials, please contact the campaign organizers via the campaign microsite.

## Why this matters

Current connectivity gaps in rural areas create educational inequalities: students lack reliable internet to access remote lessons, do homework, or apply for jobs. Stories from field partners highlight learners unable to submit assignments because of daily travel to distant towns for a single web session. Digital literacy training changes that: learners gain practical skills for online communication, safety, and job searches. This campaign aims to turn connectivity into opportunity — improving education outcomes and creating pathways to employment for rural youth.
